This repository is for my video-by-video progress of different modules of the Introduction to LangSmith course by LangChain Academy.

# Module 1 Video 1: Tracing Basics
So in this lesson, I learned how tracing works in LangChain and why it is useful for debugging and improving apps. By setting the environment variables, I could track what was happening inside the model step by step and adding metadata made it easier to organize runs in LangSmith and to review model performance over time.
I changed the question to "How do I apply the @traceable decorator to a function?"
